=========================================
Version 0.1.6

- Improved selection of curve points
- The curve points for the generation of the mask for the the B/C/S/H (Brightness/Contrast/Saturation/Hue) tool 
  can now be added by ctrl-clicking on the preview area.
- Added feathering of B/C/S/H mask
- Added H/S/L mask tool. The generated grayscale image is equivalent to the mask of the B/C/S/H tool, 
  however the advantage is that it can be used as a generic layer mask to be associated to other tools
  (like curves, blurs, etc...)
- Improved gaussian blur filter:
  - added memory caching at the filter input (improves performance significantly)
  - blur method is now the same for preview and rendering, and can be choosen from configuration dialog
  - blur method is fixed to "accurate" for radii below 5 pixels
  - blur method defaults to "fast" (sii) for radii larger than 5 pixels
- Modified sinkscreen_pf.c to allow for parallel processing of dirty tiles (one thread for each available CPU core).
  This improves the responsiveness of the preview area on multi-core machines.
- Input EXIF/XMP/IPTC metadata are now saved to the exported TIFF and JPG images, using GExiv2.
  Starting from this version, GExiv2 is therefore needed to compile PhotoFlow
- Added default layer names for several tools (instead of the generic "New Layer")
- Icons for the layer masks now represent the actual status of the mask:
  - white if mask is empty
  - a gradient if the mask contains one or more layers
  - a crossed gradient if the mask is not empty, but disabled
- Updated French transaltions

G'MIC:
- Added optional in-memory tile caching for G'MIC operations (one cache for each iteration)
- Improved G'MIC bilateral smoothing (or "surface blur" filter):
  - added padding parameter based on spatial variance (scaled to actual zoom level)
  - "value variance" is now independent of zoom level (was incorrectly scaled together with the spatial variance)
  - enabled tile caching
- Fixed multi-threaded processing of G'MIC filters under OSX 
  (by protecting all sscanf calls with a global mutex)
- The film processing presets have been moved from the "G'MIC" to the "color" category

=========================================
Version 0.1.5

- Added new "Brightness/Contrast/Saturation/Hue Adjustment" tool, which replaces the previous "Hue/Saturation Adjustment"
- Added "Volume" tool (similar to "Clarity", i.e. local contrast targeting the mid-tones), inspired by ...
- LibRAW is now compiled as a separate library (like in darktable)
- Updated darktable code to version 1.6.7
- Updated G'MIC code to version 1.6.5.0

=========================================
Version 0.1.4

- Fixed bug in update of layer's "visible" flag

=========================================
Version 0.1.3

- Fixed opacity blending of "Color" mode in RGB and Lab colorspaces
- Fixed opacity blending of "Luminosity" mode in Lab colorspace
- Fixed filling of layer list of clone tool: for clone layers inserted
  in layer masks, the parent layer was incorrectly included in the list,
  leading to a possible unresolvable circular dependency between 
  the clone layer and its source. Now the parent layer is not included
  anymore in the list of possible clone sources.
- original "visible" flag of layers renamed to "enabled", and added a new "visible"
  flag to indicate if a given layer is either directly hidden or indirectly hidden
  because some of its parents are hidden.
  The "enabled" flag now indicates if the layer is directly hidden.
- Removed fatal assertion on the validity of the output image from layer extra inputs.
  Now if the image is invalid a NULL pointer is simply added to the list of extra inputs,
  without causing a program crash. Nevertheless, a notification mechanism should be
  introduced to inform the user of the abnormal situation.
- Fixed corruption of RAW image metadata at zoom levels below 100%
- Fixed bug in the image preview at program startup
- Fixed several clang compilation warnings


=========================================
Version 0.1.2

- Added "invert" parameter to gradient tool (to reverse the direction of the gradient)
- Fixed bug that prevented correct loading of presets with multiple layers into a layer mask
- Fixed locale support (only tested with french translations under Linux)
- pfconv: output file is now overwritten in place by exiftool

=========================================
Version 0.1.1

- Added file name widget to RAW loader dialog. This allows
  to edit multiple RAW files simultaneously in the same image.

- Added digital watermarking tool based on G'MIC "watermark_fourier" filter.

- Modified Hue/saturation and brightess/contrast tools to work correctly also in Lab colorspace.
- Fixed computation of saturation adjustment. Now the saturation slider produces exactly the same
  output as the equivalent tool in GIMP (except that computations are in 32-bits floating point
  precision and are applied non-destructively). Internally, the hue/saturation tool now works 
  in the HSL colorspace like GIMP (instead of the HSV colorspace used before).
  
- Moved "RAW developer" tool into "Load" tab and removed "raw" tab.
- Moved "Color profle conversion" tool into "Color" tab and removed "conv" tab.

- Quality of Jpeg output set to "100".
