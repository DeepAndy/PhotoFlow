=========================================
Version 0.1.2

- Added "invert" parameter to gradient tool (to reverse the direction of the gradient)
- Fixed bug that prevented correct loading of presets with multiple layers into a layer mask
- Fixed locale support (only tested with french translations under Linux)
- pfconv: output file is now overwritten in place by exiftool

=========================================
Version 0.1.1

- Added file name widget to RAW loader dialog. This allows
  to edit multiple RAW files simultaneously in the same image.

- Added digital watermarking tool based on G'MIC "watermark_fourier" filter.

- Modified Hue/saturation and brightess/contrast tools to work correctly also in Lab colorspace.
- Fixed computation of saturation adjustment. Now the saturation slider produces exactly the same
  output as the equivalent tool in GIMP (except that computations are in 32-bits floating point
  precision and are applied non-destructively). Internally, the hue/saturation tool now works 
  in the HSL colorspace like GIMP (instead of the HSV colorspace used before).
  
- Moved "RAW developer" tool into "Load" tab and removed "raw" tab.
- Moved "Color profle conversion" tool into "Color" tab and removed "conv" tab.

- Quality of Jpeg output set to "100".
