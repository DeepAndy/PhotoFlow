The healing brush tool allows to clone pixels from one part of the image to another.

To define the source region, set the tool in "editing" mode and left-click on the preview area while holding down the Ctrl+Alt key.

Once the source region is defined, the pixels can be cloned by dragging the mouse while holding down the left button.

Two circles show the source and destination pixel areas. The fuzziness of the brush edges can be set from zero (sharp edges)
to 100 (very smooth edges). 

The strength of the blending between the original and cloned pixels can be set via the opacity parameter.
