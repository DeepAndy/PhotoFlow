{"name":"Photoflow","tagline":"A fully non-destructive photo retouching program providing a complete workflow from RAW image development to printing","body":"PhotoFlow\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to provide a fully non-destructive photo retouching program that includes a complete workflow from RAW image development to high-quality printing.\r\n\r\nHere is the general feature (whish)list:\r\n\r\n- Fully non-destructive, layer-based photo editing workflow with realtime preview of the final image\r\n- Support for 8-bits and 16-bits integer as well as 32-bits and 64-bits floating point precision, selectable at runtime and on a per-image basis\r\n- Plugin-based architecture: new tools can be implemented as separate modules that are loaded at runtime\r\n- Allows to load and edit images of arbitrary size, thanks to the underlying rendering engine based on the VIPS library\r\n- Fully color managed workflow: user-defined input, work and output profiles, soft-proofing, etc...\r\n- Support for layer grouping and layer masks\r\n- Support for common photo editing tools: levels, curves, brightness-contrast control, blurring, sharpening, cropping, resizing, colorspace conversions, etc..., all implemented in the form of image layers\r\n- User-friendly interface to develop new tools and image filters as external plugins\r\n\r\n# Downloading and compiling\r\n\r\nThe pixel rendering engine of PhotoFlow is based on VIPS (http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk). You have to install a recent version of VIPS in order to compile PhotoFlow.\r\n\r\nOnce VIPS is set up and running, follow these steps to download and compile PhotoFlow:\r\n\r\n1. get master branch from GitHub:\r\n\r\n        $ git clone https://github.com/aferrero2707/PhotoFlow.git\r\n\r\n2. The build system is based on CMake, so you have to have it installed in your system.\r\n   PhotoFlow provides an helper script to simplify the building process;\r\n   in order to use it you have to go into the \"build\" subdirectory and run the \"build.sh\" script:\r\n\r\n        $ cd PhotoFlow/build\r\n        $ bash ./build.sh\r\n   \r\n   If you have installed VIPS in an unusual place, you can edit the build script and set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable accordingly\r\n\r\n   To compile the code in debug mode, use\r\n   \r\n        $ bash ./build.sh debug\r\n   \r\n   instead.\r\n   \r\n3. If all goes well, you can now open an image file with PhotoFlow:\r\n\r\n        $ ./src/photoflow image_file_name\r\n\r\n   There are some test images available:\r\n\r\n        $ ./src/photoflow ../testimages/Lab_curves.pfi\r\n   or\r\n\r\n        $ ./src/photoflow ../testimages/orton.pfi\r\n        \r\n\r\n# Current status\r\n\r\nPhotoFlow is in a early development stage. The present version allows to open an image file and apply basic editing filters via non-destructive adjustment layers. The individual layers can be activated and de-activated using the radio buttons on the right of the image. Moreover, the layers structure can be saved to disk and re-opened again via the command line.\r\n\r\n# Roadmap and development plans\r\n\r\nThe following list shows what features are currently planned or being implemented, in a kind of priority order:\r\n\r\n- Support for layer maps in the gui\r\n\r\n- Implement colorpsace conversions based on ICC profiles (partly implemented already)\r\n\r\n- Allow re-ordering of existing layers via drag&drop\r\n\r\n- Complete the list of supported blending modes\r\n\r\n- Image pyramids and image zooming\r\n\r\n- Loading and processing of RAW images (demosaicing, white balance, exposure adjustment, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Pencil tool for simple hand drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
