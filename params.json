{"name":"Photoflow","tagline":"A fully non-destructive photo retouching program providing a complete workflow from RAW image development to printing","body":"PhotoFlow\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to implement a fully non-destructive photo retouching program that provides a complete workflow from RAW image development to high-quality printing.\r\n\r\nHere is the general feature (whish)list:\r\n\r\n- Fully non-destructive, layer-based photo editing workflow with realtime preview of the final image\r\n- Support for 8-bits and 16-bits integer as well as 32-bits and 64-bits floating point precision, selectable at runtime and on a per-image basis\r\n- Plugin-based architecture: most of the tools are implemented as separate modules that are loaded at runtime\r\n- Tile-based image caching to limit the memory footprint and allow loading images of arbitrary size\r\n- Fully color managed workflow: user-defined input, work and output profiles, soft-proofing, etc...\r\n- Support for layer grouping and layer masks\r\n- Support for common photo editing tools: levels, curves, brightness-contrast control, blurring, sharpening, cropping, resizing, colorspace conversions, etc..., all implemented in the form of image layers\r\n- User-friendly interface to develop new tools and image filters as external plugins\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
